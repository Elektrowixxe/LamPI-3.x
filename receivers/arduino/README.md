This is a prototype project to use an arduino board to interface an 433 MHz transmitter and receiver.

Evry Raspberry that make use of this library needs at least 2 parts:

1. These files that run on a Raspbarry. To be found in ~/receivers/arduino
2. Arduino code. See http://platenspeler.githob.io for that
